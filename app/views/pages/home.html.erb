    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, My name is Christopher Hui and I graduated from the University of California, Riverside(UCR) with a degree in Economics/Administrative Studies. I've always had an appreciation for design and web development, but never had the time to dig into it. I attended Dev Bootcamp SF in attempt to jumpstart this new found love. I look forward to continue learning more about technology and improving myself as a programmer.</p>
